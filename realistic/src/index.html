    <!--  TODO research the idiomatic thing to do for the Content Security Policy in an Electron Forge app. It seems
    like Forge uses some dynamic eval stuff during development time, and I haven't figured it out exactly. See https://github.com/electron/forge/issues/2331
    So, we'll use the unsafe policy for now but there really ought to be a way to specify a stricter policy for production.
    Read about Content Security Policies at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy
    and specifically for Electron apps, read about guidance at https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/19775 -->
